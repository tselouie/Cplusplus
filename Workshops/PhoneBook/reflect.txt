1.The copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before doing anything else because we need to avoid unpredictable behavior
if we add the self-assignment check we know that the current object is not equivalent to the source object.
2. I avoided duplication of code by setting up a copyname() function which would use the strncpy method to copy
the object's name data and put it into the current object contactName.
-I've also created the isEmpty() function that would check if the name or the number of phone number would be empty
-Lastly a display function was used to avoid repeating cout statements.
3.In this workshop I learned how to:
- create copy constructors that would duplicate and existing object.
-use an overloaded operator of '+=' to add elements into the object created by the constructor
-assign new constructor parameters an object
