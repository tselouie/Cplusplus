1. namespace is a scope of identifiers and its purpose to organize code and prevent name collisions especially when using
different implementation and header files it starts to get hard to keep track of.

2.Header files are needed because when our program needs to use functions that are defined in other files using the header file
enables us to compile the programs together without needing to redefine the function in our own program.

3. Header files are intended to be included into implementation files and only contain declarations within the file. When you
compile files there would be no need for the header file for all they do is redirect the files to other functions in another file.

4. If you include .cpp files in another file it is no different from having one giant file. Creating different files makes programs
more scalable and modular and when programs get larger it is important that the files remain relatively small so it is easier to 
implement without a lot of power.

5.In this workshop I have learned the importance of namespaces in C++ and how to use them as well as only using .cpp files to 
compile my program. As well as implementing safeguards on header files.
